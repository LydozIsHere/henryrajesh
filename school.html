  <p>
    As a Year 12 student at Dartford Grammar School for Boys, Henry has established himself
    academically, particularly in Chemistry and Biology.
  </p>

  <p>
    These subjects align closely with his long-term ambition of entering medicine, and he
    approaches them with focus and consistency.
  </p>

  <p>
    His school life reflects balance — academic commitment alongside personal development
    and discipline.
